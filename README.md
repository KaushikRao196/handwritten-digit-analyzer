# handwritten-digit-analyzer
Hey there! I first got interested in Machine learning/Artificial Intelligence in my sophomore year of highschool but did not know how to start at all. I took an introductory python course in school and applied my knowledge to basic ML models like Linear Regression. I recently decided to embark on my Deep Learning journey and decided to code a neural network with pure python(except the use of NUMPY). 
This neural network processes handwritten digits and predicts it.
Thank you!
